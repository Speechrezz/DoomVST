# DoomVST

I made this very naive [doomgeneric](https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric) port for a tweet as seen here:

Before uploading this here publicly I did a couple small tweaks to make it more useable, but this code is likely massively flawed.

**Known Issues:**

* No Sound: Ironically this Plug-In does not produce audio.

**Usage:**

* When opening the plugin you will be prompted to select a WAD file.

**Controls:**

Keyboard
* Arrow Keys: Movement
* Ctrl or Z: Fire
* Shift or A: Run
* Enter: Select

MIDI:
* Notes C4-A4

**Notable Contributions:**
* [Speechrezz](https://github.com/Speechrezz) - Added MIDI Input support

**Disclaimer:**

This Plug-In will probably crash. Please do not use this in a project file that matters to you. 
*I do not take responsibility for damage or loss of property when using this Plug-In*
