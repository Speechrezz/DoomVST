# DoomVST

I made this very naive [doomgeneric]("https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric") port for a tweet as seen here:

Before uploading this here publicly I did a couple small tweaks to make it more useable, but this code is likely massively flawed.

**Known Issues:**

* No Sound: Ironically this Plug-In does not produce audio.
* Audio Unit does not have keyboard control.

**Disclaimer:**

This Plug-In will probably crash. Please do not use this in a project file that matters to you. 
*I do not take responsibility for damage or loss of property when using this Plug-In*
